# v0.9 - 190419 - aaw - adam@deluxedistributors.com
#			Initial version. Modified from:
#  https://www.godaddy.com/community/Managing-Domains/Updating-DNS-Records-via-GoDaddy-API/td-p/124154
#
#			Added some quotes around possible empty variables. 
#			Added --insecure to curl due to old ssl code on my test server. (removed)
#			Tested for creation of new "A" records. Works good, creates new record.
#			To be used to update blah.website.ext to a proper A record resolving to the
#				current network's public IPV4 address. Use with care.

###Begin comments from original script.
# This script is used to check and update your GoDaddy DNS server to the IP address of your current internet connection.
# Special thanks to mfox for his ps script
# https://github.com/markafox/GoDaddy_Powershell_DDNS
#
# First go to GoDaddy developer site to create a developer account and get your key and secret
#
# https://developer.godaddy.com/getstarted
# Be aware that there are 2 types of key and secret - one for the test server and one for the production server
# Get a key and secret for the production server
#
# This script updates an a record at my-ip.your-godaddy-domain.com to your current ip address.
# If the A record doesn't exist it is created.
#

#Enter vaules for all variables, Latest API call requries them.
